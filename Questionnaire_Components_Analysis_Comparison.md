I've created a comprehensive analysis comparing these two questionnaire components. Here are the key takeaways:
Main Differences:
DigitalQuestionnairePage is a patient-facing component designed for:

Individual patients completing questionnaires independently
Offline-capable environments (kiosks, tablets, mobile devices)
Guided workflow with automatic progression to next steps
Simple, clean interface focused on patient experience

Questionnaires is an administrative component designed for:

Medical staff managing multiple patients' questionnaires
Comprehensive form management with tabbed sections
Advanced progress tracking and draft management
Multi-patient workflow switching

Architecture Highlights:

Form Implementation: The first uses an external DigitalQuestionnaireForm component (modular), while the second implements the form inline with react-hook-form (monolithic but comprehensive)
Offline Support: Only the DigitalQuestionnairePage has offline capabilities with local storage and sync
Patient Context: The first focuses on a single patient with rich context display, while the second allows switching between multiple patients
Data Flow: Different approaches to data management - service-based vs. direct API integration

Recommendations:

Use DigitalQuestionnairePage for patient self-service scenarios, mobile deployments, or unreliable network environments
Use Questionnaires for staff-assisted completion, administrative management, or when comprehensive progress tracking is needed
Consider a hybrid approach where both components share underlying form logic but serve different user types

The components complement each other well in a complete medical system - one optimized for patient experience, the other for administrative efficiency.
