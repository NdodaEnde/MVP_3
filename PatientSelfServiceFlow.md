Patient Self-Service Flow - Flexibility & Operations
Flexible Station Handoff ("What's Next?")
You're absolutely right! The system should be adaptive, not prescriptive. Here's how I envision it:
After questionnaire completion:

System shows: "Questionnaire Complete! âœ…"
Instead of "Go to Nursing Station" â†’ Show "Choose Your Next Station"
Display real-time station status:

ðŸŸ¢ Nursing Station - No wait (2 min)
ðŸŸ¡ Vision Testing - Short wait (5 min)
ðŸ”´ Audio Testing - Busy (15 min wait)


Patient chooses based on convenience
System updates workflow tracking regardless of chosen path

This prevents bottlenecks and gives patients control while maintaining workflow tracking.
Multi-Patient Concurrent Usage
Yes, absolutely! The system should handle:

20+ tablets/kiosks running simultaneously
Each tablet is session-isolated (one patient per device)
Real-time sync across all devices
Queue management showing available stations to all patients

Reception Check-in Flow - Eliminating Bottlenecks
Here's what I think the optimal operational flow should be:
Scenario 1: New Patient

Patient arrives â†’ Approaches reception
Receptionist asks: "First time with us?"
Quick registration (2-3 minutes):

Scan ID document (auto-populates demographics)
Select examination type (pre-employment, periodic, etc.)
Assign company/employer
Generate patient ID


Hand tablet with QR code or patient ID
Patient walks away â†’ Finds seating area
Tablet auto-loads pre-filled questionnaire

Scenario 2: Returning Patient

Patient arrives â†’ "I'm here for my annual medical"
Receptionist searches by name/ID (5 seconds)
Confirms details â†’ Updates examination type if needed
Hands tablet â†’ Patient ID already linked
Patient continues â†’ Questionnaire loads previous data where appropriate

Scenario 3: Bulk/Appointment Patients

Pre-registered patients (company sent list)
Self-check kiosks at entrance
Patient scans ID â†’ System recognizes them
Tablet auto-assigned â†’ Bypasses reception entirely
Reception handles exceptions only

Key Point: Reception becomes ID verification + tablet distribution, not detailed data entry.
