        comment: "Form loads and accepts input correctly. SA ID validation works (shows Age: 46 years). However, submit button has UI interaction issues - HTML element intercepts pointer events preventing form submission. Form data is properly filled but submission fails due to overlay/modal blocking clicks."

Form submission works correctly - SA ID validation shows 'Age: 46 years' for 7807215422081, form accepts all input, submit button clicks successfully, shows success toast 'Patient registered successfully', and navigates to questionnaire page.

        agent: "testing"
        comment: "CRITICAL FIX VERIFIED: Medical Review page is no longer blank! Patient selection dropdown is now visible and functional with mock data fallback. Page shows proper interface with patient selection, though medical review tabs need patient data integration to fully display. The blank page issue is resolved - interface now shows 'Select a patient to begin medical review' message and functional dropdown. Significant improvement from completely blank page to functional patient selection interface."

    message: "COMPREHENSIVE END-TO-END TESTING COMPLETED. CRITICAL FINDINGS: 1) Patient Registration form submission blocked by UI overlay issues - submit button cannot be clicked due to HTML element intercepting pointer events. 2) Medical Review page shows blank interface with no patient selection or review data. 3) Patient Queue, Questionnaire, Vital Signs, and Medical Tests are fully functional. 4) SA ID validation works correctly (7807215422081 shows Age: 46 years). 5) Platform can handle most of the examination workflow except registration submission and doctor review. RECOMMENDATION: Fix patient registration submit button overlay issue and investigate medical review data loading/rendering problems."
