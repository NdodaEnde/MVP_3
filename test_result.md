Form data is properly filled but submission fails due to overlay/modal blocking clicks."

    message: "COMPREHENSIVE END-TO-END TESTING COMPLETED. CRITICAL FINDINGS: 1) Patient Registration form submission blocked by UI overlay issues - submit button cannot be clicked due to HTML element intercepting pointer events. 2) Medical Review page shows blank interface with no patient selection or review data. 3) Patient Queue, Questionnaire, Vital Signs, and Medical Tests are fully functional. 4) SA ID validation works correctly (7807215422081 shows Age: 46 years). 5) Platform can handle most of the examination workflow except registration submission and doctor review. RECOMMENDATION: Fix patient registration submit button overlay issue and investigate medical review data loading/rendering problems."
