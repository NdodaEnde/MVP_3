## 🎮 **How It Works in Practice**

### **Scenario 1: Busy Monday Morning**
```
08:30 - 12 patients arrive for pre-employment medicals
Reception System:
✅ Automated check-in reduces queue from 15 to 3 minutes
✅ Smart routing prevents nursing bottleneck
✅ 8 patients choose self-service, 4 get staff assistance
✅ Real-time dashboard shows optimal flow distribution

Result: All patients processed 40% faster than before
```

### **Scenario 2: Medical Alert Patient**
```
Patient with heart condition completes questionnaire
Smart Routing:
🚨 System flags cardiovascular risk immediately
🎯 ECG station prioritized with urgent routing
👨‍⚕️ Nursing staff pre-notified with medical history
⚡ Patient routed directly, bypassing normal queue

Result: Critical patient seen immediately, no delays
```

### **Scenario 3: Station Equipment Failure**
```
Vision testing equipment breaks down
Real-time Dashboard:
🚨 System detects extended wait times automatically
📊 Redistributes patients to alternative stations
👥 Staff notified to assist with alternative routing
🔄 Workflow adjusts to maintain optimal flow

Result: No patient journey disrupted, minimal delays
```
