The AI engineer successfully took over a B2B SaaS platform, SurgiScan, focusing on digitizing occupational health examination workflows. The initial phase involved familiarization with the existing React frontend (under ) and Node.js/Express backend (under ), setting up dependencies, and verifying service operation.

A significant portion of the work revolved around identifying and fixing a persistent Invalid SA ID number checksum error. This was an iterative process, first misdiagnosing the user's valid ID, then correcting the SA ID validation algorithm to conform to official South African standards. Concurrently, a critical form binding issue in patient registration was encountered and partially addressed, where input fields reverted to placeholder values.

Further development focused on enhancing the user workflow by implementing guided navigation between medical stations post-questionnaire, transforming a manual process into a more user-friendly experience. Lastly, a comprehensive Certificate of Fitness generation system was designed and partially implemented, shifting from an AI-driven fitness determination to a doctor-controlled medical review process, aligning with proper medical protocols. The work is currently focused on resolving the form binding issue in the patient registration.

<product_requirements>
The core product is **SurgiScan**, a comprehensive B2B SaaS platform for digitizing occupational health examination workflows in South African medical facilities. It aims to replace paper-based processes with efficient digital workflows for Electronic Health Records (EHR) and Certificate of Fitness (COF) generation.

**Initial Features (MVP Level):**
*   **Patient Management:** Registration, queue management, EHR database.
*   **Clinical Workflow:** Vital signs recording, various medical tests, medical review.
*   **Documentation:** Digital questionnaires, certificates (basic), documents.
*   **Analytics:** Reports, historical processing.
*   **Advanced Features:** Offline capability, mobile optimization, multi-organization support.
*   **User Roles:** Receptionists, Nurses, Technicians, Doctors, Admins.

**Requested Enhancements & Fixes:**
1.  **SA ID Validation Fix:** Resolve Invalid SA ID number checksum error for valid South African ID numbers, consolidate multiple validation points.
2.  **Patient Registration & Medical Review Fixes:** Address issues preventing new patient registration (blocked submit button) and ensure the Medical Review page is functional.
3.  **User-Friendly Workflow:** Implement guided, seamless navigation for patients through the examination process: Registration → Medical Questionnaire → Choice for Vital Signs / Medical Tests → Medical Review → Certificate Generation. This includes progress tracking and clear next steps.
4.  **Certificate of Fitness Generation:** Integrate a system to extract relevant data from completed questionnaires, vital signs, and test results to pre-fill a Certificate of Fitness. Crucially, the system should present a draft certificate for a doctor's review, allowing the doctor to determine fitness, add comments, and provide a digital signature/stamp for the final certificate, adhering to medical compliance.

**Key File Summaries and Changes:**

*   : Main React router. Routes were added for  and .
*   : Patient registration form.
    *   **Changes:** Initially fixed submit button CSS (, , ). Later, a form binding issue (input values reverting) was identified and partially addressed by explicitly setting  properties on form fields.
*   : Doctor's review page.
    *   **Changes:** Added mock data fallback and improved error handling to prevent blank pages. Integrated certificate generation components.
*   : Main questionnaire component.
    *   **Changes:** Modified  to redirect to the new  after submission, integrating it into the new workflow.
*   : Core SA ID validation utility.
    *   **Changes:** The initial incorrect Luhn algorithm was replaced with the accurate South African ID checksum algorithm to correctly validate user's ID.
*   : Questionnaire-related services.
    *   **Changes:** Duplicate SA ID validation logic was removed to centralize validation in .
*   : Central Axios client for API calls.
    *   **Changes:** A missing  configuration was added to correctly direct API requests to the backend.
*    (New): Component to manage and display patient journey progress.
*    (New): Hook to encapsulate patient workflow logic and state.
*    (New): Displays options for next steps (Vital Signs/Medical Tests) after questionnaire completion.
*    (New): A dedicated page to render the  component.
*    (New): Generic component for displaying completion status of a medical station.
*    (New): Contains logic for generating the Certificate of Fitness PDF matching the provided template.
*    (New): Maps data from various medical forms/tests into the structured format required for the Certificate of Fitness.
*    (New): Implements the *doctor-driven* fitness assessment logic, ensuring medical decisions are made by the doctor, not automatically by the system.
*    (New): Orchestrates the entire certificate generation process, fetching data, applying fitness assessment (doctor-driven), and preparing for PDF generation.
*    (New): Provides the interface for doctors to review patient data, determine fitness, add comments, and sign off on certificates.
*   : Vite development server configuration.
    *   **Changes:** Modified to use  for file watching to resolve  errors in containerized environments.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a re-emerging **form binding issue** in the  component. After creating a new branch, the user reported that the application was showing old SA ID issues during patient registration. While the core SA ID validation algorithm in  was confirmed to be correct and working for the user's valid ID (), the problem was traced to the form itself.

The  form was observed to revert to placeholder values (e.g., , ) instead of retaining the data entered by the user (e.g., , ). This led to console warnings like SA ID number is required because the form's state was not accurately reflecting the user's input, making the SA ID validation fail at the form level even if the underlying algorithm was sound.

The AI engineer identified this as a **React Hook Form binding issue** where controlled inputs were not properly linked to the component's state. A fix was initiated by explicitly binding the  property for the  field in . The current task involves applying this same explicit  binding fix to **all other form fields** within the  component to ensure proper data persistence and allow new patient registration to function correctly end-to-end.
