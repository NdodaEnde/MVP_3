SurgiScan - MVP Specification
Product Overview
SurgiScan is a B2B SaaS platform that digitizes the occupational health examination workflow for South African medical facilities and businesses. The platform replaces the traditional paper-based process where patients move through multiple stations (questionnaire → nurse → technician → doctor → certificate generation) with a comprehensive digital workflow that creates Electronic Health Records (EHR) and generates digital Certificates of Fitness (COF).
