HealthHub Implementation Gap Analysis

  Current Implementation Status

  Frontend: 85% Complete ‚úÖ

  - Excellent: Patient registration, vital signs, medical tests,
  questionnaires, medical review, certificate management
  - Good: Dashboard, reports, basic document management
  - Missing: Advanced notifications, multi-location support, patient portal

  Backend: 15% Complete ‚ùå

  - Complete: Authentication system only
  - Missing: All core medical workflow APIs, database models, business
  logic

  Recommended Next Steps

‚è∫ Update Todos
  ‚éø ¬†‚òí Analyze existing codebase implementation against MVP specification
     ‚òí Identify missing features and functionality gaps
     ‚òí Prioritize gaps by importance and implementation complexity

‚è∫ Start Here:

  1. Create Database Models - Patient, VitalSigns, TestResults, Certificate
  2. Implement Patient Management API - Enable frontend patient workflow
  3. Build Medical Workflow APIs - Connect existing frontend to backend
  4. Add Certificate Generation - Core business value delivery

  The frontend is production-ready and waiting for backend APIs. Focus on
  backend implementation to unlock the full medical examination workflow
