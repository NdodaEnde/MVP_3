Staff-Assisted Flow Clarifications
"Override Validations with Justification"
Sometimes validation rules are too strict for real-world scenarios:
Example scenarios:

Patient doesn't know exact date of last surgery → Staff can mark "Approximately 2019" with note
Patient has unusual medical condition not in dropdown → Staff adds custom entry
Patient can't sign due to disability → Staff documents alternative consent method
Language barrier requires interpretation → Staff notes assistance provided

How it works:

Validation error appears → Staff clicks "Override"
System asks: "Reason for override?"
Staff types justification → Gets logged for audit
Form accepts the data but flags it for medical review

"Manually Triggers Handoff to Next Station"
Instead of automatic "questionnaire done → go to nursing":
Staff decides optimal routing:

Reviews patient's questionnaire responses
Checks current station queues/availability
Considers medical priorities (if patient flagged heart issues → prioritize ECG over vision test)
Selects best next station for this specific patient
System updates patient's workflow path

Example:

Patient completed questionnaire with diabetes flag
Staff sees: Nursing (busy), Blood work (available), Vision (available)
Staff chooses blood work first → More urgent given diabetes
System guides patient to blood work station
Nursing gets notified patient will come after blood work

Bottleneck Prevention Strategy
Smart Queue Management:

Real-time station monitoring → Shows capacity at each station
Dynamic routing suggestions → System recommends optimal patient flow
Staff override capabilities → When system suggestions don't make practical sense
Patient choice integration → Patients see options, staff can guide decisions

Operational Flexibility:

No rigid sequences → Patients can do tests in any order that makes sense
Exception handling → Staff can adapt to real-world situations
Multi-path workflows → System tracks completion regardless of sequence

Does this address your operational concerns? The key is making the system adaptive to real clinic operations rather than forcing clinics to adapt to rigid system requirements.
